## Introduction: what is *_data science_* and why is it important?
Defining what data science is, is still a non-trivial task. One could say that this concept is related to the discipline of building smart applications that leverage the power of statistics, computer science and specific domain knowledge and produce valuable outputs from data. With regards to this, Mike Driscoll's, CEO of Metamarket, says:  
  
_"Data science, as it’s practiced, is a blend of Red-Bull-fueled hacking and espresso-inspired statistics._  
  
_But data science is not merely hacking—because when hackers finish debugging their Bash one-liners and Pig scripts, few of them care about non-Euclidean distance metrics._  
  
_And data science is not merely statistics, because when statisticians finish theorizing the perfect model, few could read a tab-delimited file into R if their job depended on it._  
  
_Data science is the civil engineering of data. Its acolytes possess a practical knowledge of tools and materials, coupled with a theoretical understanding of what’s possible"._

The previous is a very illustrative definition of data science that leads us to think that in the end, data science is a science but also an art, in which the so well-known _data scientists_ **know more about statistics than a computer scientist and more about computer hacking than a statistician.** [See more at [1]](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/doing-data-science/9781449363871/ch01.html)

Approximately by 2016, the _data scientist_ position was considered as the "sexiest" job of the 21st century. Apparently, this new role was top in many aspects: scarse, interesting and well-paid. But, why was that figure so important? and ultimately, why is the concept of **data science** so important? In a nutshell, data science matters because it helps us make better decisions and be more accurately prepared for the future. If we simply think about evolution, information leads to better decisions, and better decisions will make species live longer. As for a cooking recipe, a data scientist would be a chef that gathers and mix a set of previously well-known ingredients to produce new or better food. 

As a consequence, data science is the extension of the scientific method applied to data in almost all fields of knowledge. From movies recommendations, fraud detection and financial risk prediction to preventive maintenance, data science has appeared to help us transform data into useful information, which in the end means increased wisdom. The following chart presents some key opportunities that data science offers to many of companies' current challenges:

Therefore, as may be expected, tech leader companies around the world have been working hard on the democratization of this concept, so that many other businesses and corporations can benefit themselves by making better decisions through data. In fact, data science is a business in which useful knowledge is sold as the most valuable product, something that most companies are willing to pay, as we are now aware of the fact that wrong decisions cost much more in the long term.

**Amazon Web Services in the era of _data science_**  
Amazon Web Services is a whole ecosystem hosted by Amazon Inc. that offers on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments through a pay-as-you-go basis. Also known as "AWS", this framework makes possible for its customers to access a variety of services in which data science utilities are included. The purpose of this brief repository is to approach the main products that AWS has disposed to perform _data science_, a concept that for the scope of this project will gather the following key topics:
  
* Data lakes
* Data analytics
* Machine learning
* Artificial intelligence

## 1. Data lakes, machine learning and analytics on top of AWS

AWS offers a set of services that allow companies create an environment that is able to process heterogeneous data and apply machine learning or analytics on it, as shown in the following schema:

In the following sections, we will approach the different stages that the previous environment covers.

### 1.1. Data movement

#### 1.1.1. On-premises data movement

#### 1.1.1. Real-time data movement

### 1.2. Data lakes

#### 1.2.1. Object storage

#### 1.2.2. Backup and archive

#### 1.2.3. Data catalog

### 1.3. Analytics

#### 1.3.1. Interactive analytics

#### 1.3.2. Big data processing

#### 1.3.3. Data warehousing

#### 1.3.4. Real-time analytics

#### 1.3.5. Operational analytics

#### 1.3.5. Visualization

### 1.4. Machine learning

## 2. Artificial intelligence on top of AWS
